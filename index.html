                <p>I'm Tander, a full-time public-school teacher in senior high school and a part-time instructor at an engineering school in our city. I found my interest in computer science way back in my college days, when programming was first introduced during my senior year. I graduated with a degree in electrical engineering, and we have studied some of the fundamentals of computers and programming. I'm fascinated with electrical machines and electrical engineering, but I have decided to focus my specialization on computer software.</p>

                <p>I did not like reading books when I was in high school. However, it was a 360 degree change of heart because today, I fully understand how the smell of a brand-new book can hook every reader. My love for reading started with one book that caught my attention - <em>The Hunger Games trilogy </em> by Suzanne Collins. I remember that while reading it, I experienced a whirlwind of emotions - sadness, fear, anger, envy, and joy - just like every character in the Inside Out movie. <br><br>Another one of my favorites is <em>Percy Jackson and the Olympians</em> by Rick Riordan, and I am on the Book 5 now. Though I should not be too proud yet, as the series conists of 7 books. Aside from science fiction books, I also enjoy life coaching and Catholic books. My favorite authors include Fr. Jose Francisco Syquia (author of <em>Exorcism: Encounters with the Paranormal and the Occult</em>), Fr. Donald Calloway (author of <em>Consecration to St. Joseph</em>), Bo Sanchez, and the late Ilsa Reyes.</p>

                <p>Sports play a significant role in my life, keeping me physically active, mentally sharp and socially engaged. I take part in sports activities, but I am not super athletic. I play basketball, volleyball, badminton, and table tennis. And among these sports, badminton is my favorite.<br><br>One of the main reasons I love badminton is that the net height (1.55 mtrs) is reasonable for my stature (1.59 mtrs). Unlike basketball and volleyball which known to be sports for taller individual, badminton focuses more on flexibility and agility. However, height difference can still provide an advantage.<br><br>I struggled with sports when I was in my teenage years. I was thin and lacked the strength to participate in energy-intensive activities. But when I took part in sports activities, it helped me accept my insecurities particularly about my body. I started training every day, going to the gym, and became conscious of what I ate. Not only that, engaging in sports also help me develop better social skills.</p>

                <p>I have a high school group that is very close to me. We have this so-called ‘once-in-a-year’ meet-up that has been happening in the month of December. The group’s name is <em>Cloud Nine+</em>, and there’s a plus symbol because it represents the additional members in the group, some of whom are the partners of my friends. What we do are similar to a high school Christmas party, but there’s a twist or theme.  It usually held in someone’s house or at a vacation place. But recently, we had our gathering at the newly marital home of one of my friends, where we shared our individual 2024 life stories through visual presentations. The experience felt like presenting a proposal to a management, where you try your best to win their approval. This annual gathering gives me a glimpse into my friends’ personal lives and professional careers, the problems they have encountered and how they managed to become resilient. It is good to have friends at my age because we often face similar challenges whether it is about career growth, family problems, or personal development.</p>
